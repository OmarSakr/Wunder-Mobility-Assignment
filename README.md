# Questions:

1-)Describe possible performance optimizations for your Code? To make the code more scalable i could
have user The abi filter splits and generates APKs specific to the device architectures.
Per-architecture-based APKs are smaller in size since the native code included for the device
architecture is compiled in the specific output APK only. and also using The density filter splits
and generates APKs based on specific device densities and screen sizes. In the density block,
provide a list of desired screen densities and compatible screen sizes that you want to include in
the APK generation.

2-)Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it? 
To use Jetpack Compose as it enables You to use
If statements to choose what should be rendered, and also can use loops to display a view multiple
times.  also use functional methods like filter, map, and many others.
